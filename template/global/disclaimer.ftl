In addition, the company's views on socially responsible marketing are subject to change in response to feedback from each of its stakeholder groups. As a result, you must ensure that prior to applying any such activities or applications in your own market you obtain specific local legal advice regarding the permissibility of that activity or application, taking into consideration both local legislation and regulations, the implementation of the International Marketing Standards and the then current views on socially responsible marketing practices.</p>
