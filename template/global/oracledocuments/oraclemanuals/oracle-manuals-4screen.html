<h2 class="main-header">4 Screen</h2>
<div class="description">
<p>4Screen is the first part of the BAT 4Suite Innovation Testing toolkit. The tool has been designed to screen and prioritise early stage ideas and concepts to help decide which ones are worth taking forward to the concept development stage.</p>
</div>
<p>4Screen can be used to test either early stage ideas or concepts &ndash; the type of test will need to be decided in advance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early stage ideas</strong> &ndash; Unbranded and &ldquo;un-priced&rdquo; ideas that include an insight, benefit (claim) and a product description.</li>
<li><strong>Early stage concepts</strong> &ndash; Branded concepts. In addition to an insight, benefit (claim) and product description they include a reason to believe, a tagline, a price and an image or illustration of the concept.</li>
</ul>
