# Jive theme

This project demonstrates how to make your customized changes in Jive theme.

If you are overridding the default look and feel or behaviour of any core Jive component, then you can change any .css, .ftl, .soy, .js file. You can add your own files also and can map them with the Presentation tier using struts-community-custom.xml.

The look and feel of SBS can be customized by modifying the contents of FreeMarker template files (*.ftl files), .soy files inside a theme, and CSS styles can also be defined in a file named custom-css.ftl.
